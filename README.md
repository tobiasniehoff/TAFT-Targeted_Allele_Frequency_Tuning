# TAFT - Targeted Allele Frequency Tuning
Toy example R script for a single replicate used in our paper in Genetics: XXX.com

You can set the starting allele frequencies, the desired allele frequencies, the selection method and more in the first lines of the script.<br/>

The packages `MoBPS` (https://github.com/tpook92/MoBPS) and `optiSel` (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optiSel/index.html) are required.<br/>

The script can simply be executed with `Ctrl` + `A` `Enter`. It runs in under a minute on a personal computer.  The script produces a single plot showing allele frequency trajectories over generations.
